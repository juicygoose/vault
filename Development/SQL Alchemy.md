[SQL Alchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/index.html) is an [[ORM]] written for [[Python]] (that uses system libraries, and thus expects a specific architecture).

In the case of M1 macs using rosetta, depending on the system libraries installed and their architecture, it can pause problems or show missing libs errors.
